# SaveDroid: An Evasion-Aware Android Malware Detection System
Welcome to SaveDroid, an advanced malware classification system designed to provide real-time Android malware classification with resilience against adversarial evasion attacks. This guide will walk you through the steps of using SaveDroid, from uploading data to interpreting results. You can follow the steps below to get started.

# Getting Started
To begin using SaveDroid, you only need an internet connection, a modern web browser, and two CSV files containing the Android application data for analysis: one for True Labels and one for Features.

# Accessing SaveDroid
**1.  Open Your Browser:** Use a modern web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

**2.  Navigate to SaveDroid:** Enter the following URL into your browser:
    https://savedroid-evamal-detector-6b6258e05538.herokuapp.com/
    
**3.  Home Screen:** After the page loads, you will be greeted by the SaveDroid homepage, which includes options to upload your files and begin the analysis.

# Overview of User Interface
The SaveDroid interface is designed for ease of use, and the following sections are visible on the homepage:
•	**File Upload Section:** Allows users to upload two required CSV files for analysis.

•	**Analysis Button:** Initiates the malware classification process.

•	**Results Section:** Displays prediction results along with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Uploading Files
Before running the malware classification analysis, you need to upload two files:

**1.  True Labels File:** This CSV file should contain information about whether each Android application is benign or malicious.

**2.  Features File:** This CSV file should contain extracted features of each Android application, such as permissions, API calls, or system behaviours.

# Step-by-Step Instructions
**1.  Locate the File Upload Section:**

    •  On the homepage, find the "Choose Files" area.
    
**2.  Upload True Labels File:**

    •  Click on the _"Choose File"_ button under the True Labels File section.
    •  Browse and select the appropriate CSV file containing the true labels.
    
**3.  Upload Features File:**

    •  Click on the _"Choose File"_ button under the Features File section.
    •  Browse and select the CSV file containing the features data.
    
**4.  Confirmation:** Both file names will be displayed next to the upload buttons when they are successfully uploaded.

# Running Malware Classification Analysis
Once the files are uploaded, you can run the classification analysis by following these steps:

**1.  Click the Predict Button:**

    •  After the files are uploaded, click on the "Predict" button to start the analysis.
    
**2.  Processing Time:**

    •  Depending on the size of the dataset, analysis may take a few seconds to a few minutes.
    •  A progress indicator will be shown during this process.
    
**3.  Results Display:**

    •  After the analysis is complete, you will see metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and more.

# Interpreting Results
After running the analysis, SaveDroid will provide several key metrics:

**1.  Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly identified benign and malicious apps.

**2.  Precision:** How many of the predicted malicious apps were actually malicious.

**3.  Recall:** The proportion of actual malicious apps that were correctly identified.

**4.  F1-Score:** A weighted average of precision and recall.

**5.  Confusion Matrix:** Displays the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

The results will help you understand how effective the model was in distinguishing between benign and malicious applications.

#  Viewing Detailed Results
For a more detailed analysis of individual applications:

**1.  Access Detailed Prediction Results:**

    •  Click on the "View Detailed Prediction Results" button available on the main results page.
    
**2.  Detailed Results Page:**

    •  This page will display each application’s predicted label alongside its true label.
    •  You can also sort or filter the data to focus on specific results.

#  FAQ
**Q: What file formats does SaveDroid support?**

A: SaveDroid supports CSV format for both the True Labels and Features files.

**Q: What happens if I upload an incorrectly formatted file?**

A: SaveDroid will notify you if the file format is incorrect or if the file cannot be processed. Ensure your files follow the required structure.

**Q: How large of a dataset can SaveDroid handle?**

A: SaveDroid can handle both small and large datasets. Larger datasets may require more time for processing.

#  Sample Dataset
A sample dataset is available for users to test SaveDroid before using their own datasets. This
dataset contains both a True Labels file and a Features file and can be found on the SaveDroid
GitHub repository. You can download it here: https://github.com/omsoo/SaveDroid_evasion_malware_detector/tree/main/_test_data_

# Future Work
•	Expansion of Dataset: Incorporate a wider variety of malware and benign apps to improve generalizability.

•	Hybrid Models: Explore combining KNN with other ML techniques to leverage the strengths of different algorithms.

•	Real-time Detection: Implement real-time analysis and detection capabilities.

•	Continuous Learning: Develop mechanisms for the model to adapt to new threats dynamically.
